# Fake_News_REVEALer
In this study, we employed several popular machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost, as classifiers to detect fake news. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of leveraging diverse machine learning algorithms and their ensemble techniques to tackle the multifaceted nature of fake news detection. Such an approach provides a more nuanced understanding of news authenticity, enabling users to make more informed decisions about the information they consume and share.
